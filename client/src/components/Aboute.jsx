          I am a passionate and dedicated MERN Stack Developer with a strong focus on building
          modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into
          real-world products using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
          Currently, I am learning and improving my skills through hands-on projects, where I
          implement features such as JWT authentication, OTP verification, image upload with
          Cloudinary, and RESTful APIs. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following
          best practices in frontend development. I am highly motivated, always eager to learn new
          technologies, and excited to grow as a professional developer. My goal is to work in a
          collaborative environment where I can contribute, learn from experienced developers, and
          build impactful digital products.
